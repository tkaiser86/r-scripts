# Tims R scripts

Included so far:

## VARtoEdges.R ##

A script that I use to convert a `varest` object generated by `vars::VAR` to edge lists (between and within time) that can be plotted using `qgraph`.

## complexity.R

Analyzes the complexity of a time series by calculating fluctuation and dispersion parameters in moving time windows. Results in a time series of complexity values that can be used to detect critical instabilities. 

## timsaux.R ##

Miscellaneous simple functions that I use every now and then.
